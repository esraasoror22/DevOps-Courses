Drawbacks
 ------------>
1) my_sql_secure_installation -----> script need to be run through ansible
2) Create tables , ..... for wordpress need to be automated not login to mysql
3) All shell modules run each time we run playbook we control running of them for files only not for editing on files

4) Installed php8.3-fpm and php8.3-mysql at beginning
